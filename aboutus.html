			We are a family run business and would like to welcome you to be a part of our family. 
			Our original location in Turkey is what started it all with our grandmother working 
			the front and back of the restaurant. Our grandmother passed away a few years ago and 
			she left us with her recipes. The best part of our recipes is that not only was it passed 
			down through generations, but all our ingredients are sourced locally. 
		</p>
		<p>
			We have built our experience by cooking these dishes besides our grandmother and have 
			perfected them over the years. With the ultimate quality check coming from grandma and 
			grandpa you can be sure that each recipe is quality tested and approved. We also cater 
			to our family members who are vegetarian and vegan by offering 100% vegan falafels. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Our grandmother had a dream of opening a restaurant in a big city like New York, and 
			after her passing we decided to keep her memories alive by sharing her love of food and 
			cooking with our new location. We hope you enjoy the food that we grew up on and love so 
			much because we love making it. Our recipes are hundreds of years old and we are proud 
			to share them with each one of you, “our new family”.
