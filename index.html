		   We welcome you to the King of Falafel and Shawarma. We pride ourselves in making the best food 
		   with the freshest ingredients. We hope you always come back and try all our dishes in their 
		   different variations. We have platters, sandwiches, soups, desserts and a variety of drinks. 
		   We know our portions are big, so please feel free to ask for a bag and dish to take the remainder 
		   of your food with you.
		</p>
		<p>
			We source our ingredients from local farms all around New York and grow some of our own. We have 
			spicy and non-spicy options. You can tell a menu item is spicy because it would have a red pepper 
			icon next to the menu item. If there is an item on the menu which indicate that it is spicy, but 
			you donâ€™t want it to be, please ask the waiter/waitress that you would like it non-spicy. We hope 
			you enjoy your time here because when you are here, you are family.
